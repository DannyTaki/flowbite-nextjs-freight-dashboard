  title: Freightview API v2.0
  description: |
    # Introduction

    The Freightview API is designed using the principles of REST APIs. It features predictable URLs that are focused on resources and their actions. We also take advantage of HTTP's built-in features, such as HTTP verbs and HTTP authentication. All responses to the Freightview API are returned in JSON.

    **You must have an active account and carriers added to your account in Freightview to use the API.**

    ## Getting started

    ### Freightview API v2.0 Endpoints

    * **Production:** https://api.freightview.com/v2.0

    * **Sandbox:** https://api.freightview.dev/v2.0

    Access to the sandbox environment is granted automatically, and will be available 24 hours after your Freightview account is setup and carriers have been added. If you have issues accessing the Freightview sandbox environment, please contact the Freightview support team via chat, email (support@freightview.com) or phone (913.353.6188).

    Read more about migrating to Freightview API v2.0 [here](#section/Migrating-from-v1.0-to-v2.0).

    ## Technical details

    ### Rate limiting

    The Freightview API does have a limit of 120 requests per minute, per endpoint. When this limit is exceeded the API will return HTTP status 429. The response headers include custom headers showing the rate limit (`Ratelimit-Limit`), how many remaining requests can be made within the time period (`Ratelimit-Remaining`), and how many seconds are remaining until the limit is reset (`Ratelimit-Reset`).

    Example of the `Ratelimit` headers:
    ```yaml
    Ratelimit-Limit: 20
    Ratelimit-Remaining: 19
    Ratelimit-Reset: 13
    ```

    ### Request headers

    All requests made to the Freightview API should include an `Accept:application/json` header, to avoid an HTTP 406 Not Acceptable error. If a request includes a request body, the `Content-Type:application/json` header should also be included.

        This endpoint can be used to retrieve shipments from Freightview, via a `search` query parameter and/or various filters available as query parameters (e.g. `status`).

        **Query Parameters**

        All query parameters that are arrays are serialized in form style (i.e. the query parameter is repeated for each value in the array).

        For example, a search for shipments that are in `confirmed` or `delivered` `status`, should be sent like this: `https://{baseUrl}/shipments?status=confirmed&status=delivered`.

    Freightview uses OAuth 2.0 as the authentication for v2.0. You must generate a token using your `client_id` and `client_secret`. These values are available in the "API Integration" section of your Freightview user settings (select the gear icon in the upper right of Freightview's user interface).

    There is no need to generate a new token with each request, as the generated token is valid for 24hrs. We recommend caching the token to avoid unnecessary requests to the authentication endpoint.

    The following sections provide helpful information on using Freightview API v2.0

    # Example truckload API workflow

    This is an example truckload workflow using the Freightview v2.0 API endpoints throughout the entire shipment lifecycle. (Customers can use the APIs to achieve other specific workflows; this example is provided to aid understanding of the capabilities of the Freightview truckload APIs.)

    1. Create shipment using the [create shipment](#tag/Truckload/operation/truckloadCreateShipment) endpoint.
    2. Retrieve available quotes (if any) using the [get shipment quotes](#tag/Shipments/operation/shipmentsGetQuotes) endpoint. Examples of available rates at this stage in the workflow include:
        - applicable contracted rates that have been added for your carriers to your account in Freightview
        - rates returned automatically from truckload carrier APIs (e.g. C.H. Robinson)
    3. If no rates are available, or you'd like to request spot quotes from additional carriers, use the [request quotes for shipment](#tag/Truckload/operation/truckloadRequestForQuotes) endpoint.
    4. After a given amount of time, retrieve available quotes using the [get shipment quotes](#tag/Shipments/operation/shipmentsGetQuotes) endpoint.
    5. Select a quote and award it to the carrier using the [award shipment to carrier](#tag/Truckload/operation/truckloadAwardShipment) endpoint.
    6. Use the [get shipment details](#tag/Shipments/operation/shipmentsGetShipmentById) endpoint to check the shipment `status`:

        - If the `status` has been updated to `confirmed`, the carrier has confirmed they will accept and transport the shipment.
        - If the `status` returns to `pending`, the carrier has rejected the shipment. Use the [get shipment quotes](#tag/Shipments/operation/shipmentsGetQuotes) and [award shipment to carrier](#tag/Truckload/operation/truckloadAwardShipment) endpoints to select a quote from another carrier and award the shipment.
    7. Once the shipment has been confirmed, you can use the [get shipment details](#tag/Shipments/operation/shipmentsGetShipmentById) endpoint to retrieve the bill of lading.
    8. As the shipment is picked up and transported to its destination, you can use the [get shipment tracking history](#tag/Shipments/operation/shipmentsGetTrackHistory) endpoint to retrieve the shipment's tracking history.
    9. Throughout the shipment lifecycle, if the shipment needs to be edited or canceled, you can use the [edit shipment](#tag/Truckload/operation/truckloadEditShipment) or [cancel shipment](#tag/Truckload/operation/truckloadCancelShipment) endpoints respectively.

    # Migrating from v1.0 to v2.0

    ### Why a version change?

    The Freightview API has remained on v1.0 since it's creation, even as it has added support for additional modes (such as parcel). But with the addition of a full-featured full truckload tool to Freightview (and specifically support for multi-stop shipments), there were schema changes made that are not backwards compatible.

    Thus, in order to maintain the functionality of v1.0, but also allow access to the new truckload functionality, the Freightview API is adding v2.0.

    ### Who should migrate?

    If you are using the rate and book endpoints for LTL and parcel, there are currently **no changes to these API workflows** and they will remain on API v1.0 for the foreseeable future.

    If you are using either the LTL or parcel workflows and the full truckload workflow and are retrieving shipment information via the shipment search and shipment information API endpoints, you will want to begin migrating to v2.0.

    If you are using the full truckload workflow and want to integrate its capabilities via API, then you will want to implement v2.0.

    ### Functionality changes

    The initial release of v2.0 added the ability to search & retrieve shipment data for all shipments in Freightview regardless of workflow (LTL, parcel, truckload).

    The full release of v2.0 added all the capabilities of Freightview's Truckload tool to the Freightview APIs.

    ### Authentication changes

    The Freightview API v1.0 uses HTTP Basic authentication. The Freightview API v2.0 is upgrading to use OAuth to generate a Bearer token, which is then used to authenticate requests made to all other v2.0 endpoints.

    ### Data changes

    #### Shipment

    - The `id` field is now `shipmentId`.
    - The `files` array is now `documents` array.
      - `subType` is now `source.`
    - The `archived` flag is now `isArchived`.
    - The `tracking.history` array is now returned by the separate [shipment tracking history endpoint](#tag/Shipments/operation/shipmentsGetTrackHistory).
    - The `bolNum` is now in `bol.bolNumber`.
    - The data in the `accessorials` array has been split, some of the accessorials are in `equipment.accessorials` and the others are in `location.accessorials`.

    #### Location
    - The `origin` object is now an object within the `locations` array, with `type : origin`.
    - The `destination` object is now an object within the `locations` array, with `type : destination`.
    - Location reference numbers are now an array of reference number objects on the `location` instead of a single field (e.g. `origin.referenceNumber`) on the location.
    - Location `dockHoursOpen` is now `opensAt` and is now in 24-hr time.
    - Location `dockHoursClose` is now `closesAt` and is now in 24-hr time.
    - Location `shipType` is now returned as kebab-case values in the `key` field in the `accessorials` array.

    #### Item
    - The `pieces` field is now `quantity`.
    - The `package` field is now `type`.
    - The `nmfc` field is now split between two fields, `nmfcNumber` and `nmfcSubNumber`.
    - The `hazard` object is now the `hazardous` object.
      - The `hazardClass` field is now `primaryClass`.
      - The `hazardSubClass1` field is now `secondaryClass`.
      - The `hazardSubClass2` field is now `tertiaryClass`.
      - The `specialPermit` field is now `permitNumber`.
    - Instead of the `saidToContain` and `saidToContainPackagingType` fields, the `contains` array has objects that have a `quantity` and `type`.

    #### Rate
    - The `rate` object is now `selectedQuote`.
    - `total` is now `amount`.
    - `days` is now `transitDaysMin` and `transitDaysMax`.
    - The combination of `serviceType` and `serviceOption` is replaced by `serviceId`.
    - `carrier` is now `assetCarrierName`.
    - `carrierCode` is now `assetCarrierCode`.
    - `provider` is now `providerName` and is returned for all quotes, not just brokerage quotes.
    - `providerCode` is now returned for all quotes, not just brokerage quotes.
    - `time`, `rural`, and `daysPlus` fields are not returned.

    #### Dispatch
    - The `dispatch` object has been removed, and the information from its fields is reflected in various other objects, as detailed below.
    - The `dispatch.carrierId` field is now `selectedQuote.carrierId`.
    - The `dispatch.carrier` field is now `selectedQuote.providerName`.
    - The `dispatch.carrierCode` field is now `selectedQuote.providerCode`.
    - The `dispatch.schedulePickup` flag is not directly replicated, but the `pickup.status` field can be used to match to its values. If `pickup.status` is `not-requested`, this is equivalent to `schedulePickup: false`, any other value equates to `schedulePickup : true`.
    - The `dispatch.bolStatus` field is now `bol.status`.
    - The `dispatch.pickupNum` field is now `pickup.confirmationNumber`.
    - The `dispatch.proNum` field is now `tracking.trackingNumber`.

    # Truckload integration scenarios

    Version 2.0 of the Freightview API allows integration of Freightview's full truckload capabilities into your own system.

    There are a number of ways to integrate the truckload functionality, depending on desired workflow and amount of integration that is needed between systems. These are described below, from most integrated to least integrated.

    ## Minimal integration -->

    # Migrating from Enterprise TMS API to Freightview API

    Enterprise TMS (ETMS) is a transportation management software solution provided by C.H. Robinson (Freightview's parent company) that is being sunset.

    This guide is provided to aid developers who are upgrading their systems to connect to the Freightview APIs.

    ### API type

    The ETMS API uses the SOAP protocol with XML request / response bodies, whereas Freightview's API is structured using RESTful principles with JSON request / response bodies.

    ### Authentication

    - ETMS uses a username/password (`authentication ID` / `authentication key`) in each SOAP request.
    - For Freightview API v1.0, HTTP Basic Authentication is used, with a user's Freightview API key as the Basic Auth `username` in each HTTP request header.
    - For Freightview API v2.0, OAuth 2.0 is used to generate a bearer token, which is used for requests to all endpoints.

    ### LTL shipment API comparison

    | Action | ETMS API endpoint | Freightview API endpoint |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Rate LTL shipment | `PostEditLTLShipment` | POST `/v1.0/rates` |
    | Edit LTL shipment | `PostEditLTLShipment` | (Send a new `/v1.0/rates` request with the modified shipment information. </br> FV will return a new shipment `id`) |
    | Book LTL shipment | `OfferShipment` | POST `/v1.0/book` |
    | Track LTL shipment | `GetShipmentStatus` | GET `/v2.0/shipments/{shipmentId}/tracking` |
    | Cancel LTL shipment | `CancelShipment` | - |
    | Retrieve documents for LTL shipment | n/a | GET `/v2.0/shipments/{shipmentId}` (`documents` array) |
    | Search for LTL shipment | n/a | GET `/v2.0/shipments` |

    ### TL shipment API comparison

    | Action | ETMS API endpoint | Freightview API endpoint |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Create TL shipment | `PostEditShipment` | POST `/v2.0/shipments/truckload` |
    | Request TL spot-quotes | n/a | POST `/v2.0/shipments/truckload/quotes/{shipmentId}/request`
    | Get TL shipment quotes | `GetQuotes` | GET `/v2.0/shipments/{shipmentId}/quotes` |
    | Edit TL shipment | `PostEditShipment` | PUT `/v2.0/shipments/truckload/{shipmentId}` |
    | Award TL shipment | `OfferShipment` | POST `/v2.0/shipments/truckload/{shipmentId}/award` |
    | Retract TL shipment | `DropCarrier` | POST /`v2.0/shipments/truckload/{shipmentId}/retract` |
    | Track TL shipment | `GetShipmentStatus` | GET `/v2.0/shipments/{shipmentId}/tracking` |
    | Cancel TL shipment | `CancelShipment` | DELETE `/v2.0/shipments/truckload/{shipmentId}` |
    | Retrieve documents for TL shipment | n/a | GET `/v2.0/shipments/{shipmentId}` (`documents` array) |
    | Search for TL shipment | n/a | GET `/v2.0/shipments` |

    # Labels

      On the [shipment details](#tag/Shipments/operation/shipmentsGetShipmentById) endpoint, the `labelSize` and `labelCount` query parameters can be used to indicate what size of labels and how many labels to return for the shipment. (These query parameters do not apply to parcel shipments, whose labels are 4x6 and are generated by the carrier).

      ### Label Size
      The labels Freightview generates fall into two categories, roll and sheet. Below are the `labelSize` values, divided by category.

      #### Sheet

      - `8.5x11` - full page label
      - `5.5x8.5` - two labels per page
      - `3.5x5` - four labels per page
      - `4x3.3` - six labels per page
      - `4x2` - ten labels per page


      #### Roll

      - `4x8`
      - `4x6`
      - `3x5`
      - `3x4`
      - `2.25x4`
      - `4x1`

      ### Label Count

      The label count determines how many labels get generated per shipping item, e.g. pallet. The supported `labelCount` values are `1`, `2`, and `4`.
